# Welcome

Ragas is a framework that helps you evaluate your Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. RAG denotes a class of LLM applications that use external data to augment the LLMâ€™s context. There are existing tools and frameworks that help you build these pipelines but evaluating it and quantifying your pipeline performance can be hard. This is where Ragas (RAG Assessment) comes in.

Ragas provides you with the tools based on the latest research for evaluating LLM-generated text to give you insights about your RAG pipeline. Ragas can be integrated with your CI/CD to provide continuous checks to ensure performance.
